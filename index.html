    <h1>THE SPECS</h1>
    <p class="study">Each Bored Ape is unique and programmatically
         generated from over 170 possible traits,
          including expression, headwear, clothing,
           and more. All apes are dope,
         but some are rarer than others.</p>

            the Ethereum blockchain and hosted on IPFS.
            (See Record and Proof.)
            Purchasing an ape costs 0.08 ETH.

        </p>

        <p class="study">To access members-only areas such as THE BATHROOM , Apeholders
            will need to be signed into their Metamask Wallet.</p>
