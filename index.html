    <h1>THE SPECS</h1>
    <p>Each Bored Ape is unique and programmatically
    generated from over 170 <br>
    possible traits,
    including expression, headwear, clothing,
 and more. All apes are dope,
    but some are rarer than others.</p>

 <p>The apes are stored as ERC-721 tokens on
     the Ethereum blockchain and hosted on IPFS.
   <a href="">(See Record and Proof.)</a>
    Purchasing an ape costs 0.08</p>

    <h1>WELCOME TO THE CLUB</h1>
    <p>When you buy a Bored Ape, you’re not simply buying an avatar or a provably-rare piece of art. You are gaining membership access to a club whose benefits and offerings will increase over time. Your Bored Ape can serve as your digital identity,
         and open digital doors for you.</p>

  <p>The BAYC Bathroom will become operational once the presale  <br> period is
     It contains a canvas accessible only to wallets containing at least one ape.<br>
      Like any good dive bar bathroom, this is the place to draw,<br> scrawl,
       or write expletives.</p>

       <p>Each ape-holder will be able to paint a pixel on the bathroom <br>
        wall every fifteen minutes. Think of it as a collaborative art<br> experiment
         for the cryptosphere. A members-only canvas for the discerning 
         minds of crypto twitter.<br>
        We're pretty sure it's going to be full of dicks.</p>
